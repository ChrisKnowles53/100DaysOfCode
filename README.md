# 100DaysOfCode
My 100 days Bootcamp14 journey from zero to coder

Day 1: Today was spent discussing the outline of the course and working in teams as well as highlighting some of the possible pitfalls.

Today's progress: I cannot expect to understand everything to the nth degree.  This has the potential to derail my overall learning.

Thoughts: Dont lose sight of life outside of Bootcamp - make Bootcamp fit with my hobbies - This will keep me motivated.

Day 2: It was intresting to spend more detil time on computational thinking and really focussing on breaking the problem down and looking for patterns.  Working with GIT is going to be about muscle memory the more you do it hte easier it becomes.

Today's progress: Being able to describe GIT, flow diagrams and problem solving to others is cementing my knowledge.

Thoughts: I feel as though my literal thinking could also be a blind spot not seeing the grey area not everything is ones and zeros when dealing with people.
