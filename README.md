# 100DaysOfCode
My 100 days Bootcamp14 journey from zero to coder

Day 1: Today was spent discussing the outline of the course and working in teams as well as highlighting some of the possible pitfalls.

Today's progress: I cannot expect to understand everything to the nth degree.  This has the potential to derail my overall learning.

Thoughts: Dont lose sight of life outside of Bootcamp - make Bootcamp fit with my hobbies - This will keep me motivated.
